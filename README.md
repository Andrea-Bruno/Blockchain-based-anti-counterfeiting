# **A Simple Scan that Revolutionizes Security**

**Guarantee of Authenticity** is an innovative system that protects buyers and sellers from counterfeiting. Its strength lies in its **ease of use**: simply scan the code on the product with your smartphone to get an immediate and certain verification of its authenticity and legitimate ownership.

This result is possible thanks to an extremely advanced underlying technology—based on blockchain and cryptography—which, however, remains completely invisible to the user. For you, it's as simple as taking a picture.

**Why is it an Evolution Compared to Other Systems?**

Current methods (like QR codes that link to a website) are based on trust: you have to trust that the database the code links to is managed honestly and securely. **VerificaAutentica** (Authenticity Verification) completely eliminates this need, introducing a **"trustless"** system.

## **What does "Trustless" mean?**

In cryptography, **"trustless"** does not mean "untrustworthy". On the contrary, it means that the system is designed so that **you are not forced to trust anyone** because you can verify everything yourself.

*   **Traditional System (with Trust):** It's like an authority telling you "This product is authentic, trust me." You must hope that authority is honest and that its database has not been tampered with.
*   **Trustless System (Without Trust):** It's like a transparent lock with a unique and impossible-to-copy signature. Anyone can look at the lock and, by following public mathematical rules, verify with certainty whether it is authentic or not, **without having to trust the opinion of another**.

**VerificaAutentica** applies this principle: the proof of authenticity does not reside in a central database, but in a unique and incontrovertible "digital signature" associated with each individual product, verifiable autonomously by anyone in a few seconds.

**The Advantage for You:**

*   **Absolute Certainty:** Verification is based on mathematical laws, not on someone's promise.
*   **Total Transparency:** You can see the entire provenance history of the product.
*   **Simplicity:** No technical skills required. Scan and get the answer.

**Guarantee of Authenticity:** the complexity of cryptography working for you, to offer you the simplicity of a verification you can trust.

# SUMMARY

Anti-counterfeiting technology has attracted significant attention with economic development. Many counterfeit products that are difficult to identify have been produced, severely harming consumer interests. The public's attitude of seeking small savings and low cost has encouraged unscrupulous manufacturers to take advantage, offering low-cost counterfeit products, squeezing the profits of legitimate manufacturers, and causing a loss of public trust in product quality. Currently, the most widespread anti-counterfeiting system is based on commercially available QR codes or RFID tags, but these systems often rely on centralized databases, introducing single points of failure and a need for trust in the managing entity.

This project proposes a radically **trustless** system (requiring no trust in intermediaries) based on blockchain technology and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) tokens. The system **does not just** provide traceability, but immutably and publicly verifiably certifies both the authenticity and the **ownership** of the asset. The **Manufacturer**, equipped with a digital identity, issues a **digital certificate** signed digitally for each individual product, containing production data, characteristics, terms of use, and warranty. The cryptographic hash of this certificate is embedded into an **NFT token** that represents the product itself.

Ownership of this NFT token equates to the digital title of ownership of the physical asset. The transfer of ownership occurs through the transfer of the NFT token between digital wallets, recorded immutably on the blockchain. A QR code or RFID tag on the product contains only the **certificate hash** or a unique identifier of the NFT token, acting as a simple **physical link** to access the verification system. By scanning the code, anyone can, anonymously and without requiring an account, verify the product's authenticity by comparing the hashes and consult the **public key** of the wallet that legally holds the NFT token (and thus the asset), ensuring the seller is indeed the legitimate owner before purchase. This approach eliminates the need to trust central authorities, drastically reduces certification costs, and guarantees an incontrovertible, decentralized, and permanent verification of authenticity and ownership.

# PREMISE

Counterfeiting involves the production, import, export, distribution, and sale of non-authentic consumer goods designed and branded to appear identical to original products. It is done to deceive consumers, convincing them of their authenticity. Counterfeiting also includes applying the trademark or logo of a well-known consumer brand to a product, even though it is not actually made or authorized by that brand. Simply put, counterfeit products are imitations of real products manufactured without the approval of the trademark owner. Counterfeit products are generally of substantially lower quality than authentic goods and can even be dangerous, as they are often poorly made or use hazardous or toxic chemicals and materials. Counterfeit products range from high-end luxury goods like watches, perfumes, or leather goods, to business-to-business products like machinery, chemicals, or spare parts, to common consumer products like toys, medicines, cosmetics, and food. In fact, any product protected by intellectual property can be counterfeited. Unfortunately, many well-known and successful companies, in almost all industries, are victims of counterfeiting.

## History of Blockchain

Blockchain is not just a database, but a new technological stack with "digital trust" that is revolutionizing the way we exchange value and information over the Internet, removing the "middlemen" from the process. The first blockchain-like protocol was proposed by cryptographer David Chaum in 1982. Later, in 1991, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta wrote about their work on Consortiums. But it was Satoshi Nakamoto (presumed pseudonym of a person or group of people) who invented and implemented the first blockchain network after deploying the world's first digital currency, Bitcoin. Since blockchain technology is the underlying technology, it cannot be owned. It's like the Internet. But anyone can use the technology to run and own their own blockchains.

## Problem Statement

Counterfeiting is not a victimless crime. Counterfeiters often take advantage of consumers' desire for low prices. Buying counterfeit products may seem like a cheap option compared to the original, but that low price comes at a high cost to oneself and others. Manufacturing organizations operating in compliance with the law are threatened by counterfeiting because it causes revenue losses. Counterfeiting can occur with both local and branded products. Counterfeit and low-quality products ignore consumer safety. Counterfeit products degrade the economy. A vendor-based product verification portal has several limitations, including security breaches and long-term inaccessibility. The need is therefore for a decentralized, immutable, and publicly verifiable system that certifies the origin and ownership of an asset.

## Existing System

Most companies that value their brand and business have tracking and control mechanisms to discourage, if not eliminate, the production and distribution of counterfeits. This includes hologram stickers, watermarks, mass communication, surprise checks, controlled distribution systems, and robust ERP system implementations.
*   **Identifying Counterfeits via QR Code on Smartphones:** The solution involves simple QR code-based identification that can help the end user and the company's seller scan and identify the product's authenticity using a smartphone.
*   **NFC Technology-Based Anti-Counterfeiting Solutions:** The customer can use smartphones with NFC functionality to tap and read data on the NFC chip applied to the product to verify its authenticity.
*   **RFID-Based Anti-Counterfeiting Tracking and Tracing Solution:** Radio Frequency Identification uses tiny chips that emit electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.
*   **RFID Electronic Label-Based Anti-Counterfeiting Method:** According to the method, a binding is made between an ultra-high frequency electronic label and a product that requires an anti-counterfeiting process.
These systems, while useful, often remain centralized or siloed, limiting their effectiveness and overall trust.

## Proposed System

In the proposed Blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting system, each **actor in the supply chain** (e.g., suppliers, manufacturers, factories, logistics operators, retailers, and consumers) participates as a node in the Blockchain to conduct transactions and help keep the Blockchain updated. Upon joining the Blockchain, each node is assigned a public/private key pair to perform secure cryptographic operations according to the Blockchain architecture.

**Core Innovation: Trustless System of Authenticity and Ownership**
Unlike similar systems that use QR codes or RFID simply to link to a centralized database (creating a single point of failure and requiring trust in the database manager), the system proposed here is completely **trustless** and decentralized.

The **Manufacturer**, equipped with a **digital identity**, issues a digitally signed **digital certificate** for each individual product. This certificate, publicly viewable, contains key data such as production data, product characteristics, terms and conditions of use, warnings, and warranty details.

The unique and immutable **cryptographic hash** of this certificate is embedded during the creation phase into an **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)** that digitally represents the product. Initially, this token is owned by the manufacturer and certifies authenticity and origin. From the moment of the first sale, the NFT token becomes representative of the **ownership** of the physical asset. The transfer of ownership of the asset occurs exclusively through the transfer of the NFT token from the seller's wallet to the buyer's wallet on the blockchain, an operation recorded permanently and immutably.

**Role of the QR Code / RFID: A simple link, not a database**
The QR code or RFID tag physically applied to the product **does not contain sensitive data** and is not the primary vector of authenticity. It contains only the **certificate hash** or the **unique identifier of the NFT token**. Its function is purely to be an **access point**, a physical link that redirects whoever scans it (via app or web app) to the decentralized telematic system for verification.

**Trustless Verification of Authenticity and Ownership**
A consumer scanning the code on a product in a store triggers the following trustless process:
1.  The system retrieves the hash or ID from the code.
2.  By querying the blockchain (public read, no login required), it retrieves:
    *   The hash of the original certificate stored in the NFT token's metadata.
    *   The address of the wallet (public key) that is currently the owner of the NFT token.
3.  It independently retrieves the original digital certificate from the manufacturer's public repository (using the hash or ID as a reference).
4.  It calculates the hash of the newly retrieved certificate.
5.  **Authenticity Comparison:** If the calculated hash matches EXACTLY the hash stored on the blockchain, the product is authentic. Any discrepancy indicates a counterfeit.
6.  **Ownership Verification:** The system displays the **public key** of the current owner of the NFT token. In a retail context, the consumer can verify that this public key matches the one publicly disclosed by the retailer themselves, confirming that the seller is the legitimate owner of the asset they are selling.

**Ownership Transfer**
At the time of purchase, the buyer receives the NFT token in their digital wallet via a transaction on the blockchain. This transfer irrevocably updates the ownership of the asset. From that moment, a new scan of the code will show the public key of the new owner, demonstrating the transfer of ownership in a transparent and incontrovertible manner.

This system completely eliminates the need to trust a central authority for the verification of the asset's authenticity or ownership. The verification is based on cryptographic mathematics and the decentralized consensus of the blockchain, making the system immune to tampering and counterfeiting.

# METHODOLOGY

## System Architecture
A system architecture is the conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and other views of a system. An architectural description is a formal description and representation of a system, organized to support reasoning about the system's structures and behaviors.

**Trustless Innovation and Role of the Physical Code:**
The system is designed to be **trustless**. The QR code or RFID on the product (**Physical Tag**) contains only an identifier (e.g., the certificate hash or the NFT token ID). Its only function is to be read by a scanner and **redirect** the device to the **Public Verification Platform** (e.g., a website or a decentralized app - dApp).

The Public Verification Platform, interacting with the **Blockchain** and the **Public Certificate Repository**, performs the cryptographic verifications autonomously and transparently for the user:
1.  Retrieves data from the blockchain (stored hash, current owner).
2.  Retrieves the certificate from the public repository.
3.  Performs the cryptographic hash comparison.
4.  Displays the authenticity result and the public key of the legitimate owner to the user.

The user does not have to trust the platform: they can potentially verify the data on the blockchain themselves. The platform is just an interface that facilitates this verification.

## System Flow
System flows are models that show the activities and decisions that systems perform. They are useful for understanding complex system interactions because they visually show the back-and-forth interactions between systems and complex branches.

**Main Flow: Authentication and Ownership Verification**
1.  **Consumer:** Initiates verification on the Web Portal (provides NFT ID or code scan).
2.  **Web Portal:** Sends request to the Blockchain (read the smart contract to get the hash stored in the NFT token and the ownership history).
3.  **Blockchain / Smart Contract:** Returns the certificate hash and the transfer history.
4.  **Web Portal:** Sends request to the Public Certificate Repository (to get the original certificate based on the product/NFT ID).
5.  **Certificate Repository:** Returns the digital certificate.
6.  **Web Portal:** Locally calculates the hash of the received certificate.
7.  **Web Portal:** Compares the calculated hash with the hash retrieved from the blockchain.
    *   If they **MATCH** -> Authentic Product + Show ownership history (if public).
    *   If they **DO NOT MATCH** -> Possible Counterfeit/Tampering -> Alert the User and (optionally) Alert the Manufacturer.
8.  **Web Portal:** Displays the verification result to the Consumer.

**Supply Chain Actors (Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer):** Interact primarily with the system through their Wallets and the Web Portal to:
*   **Manufacturer:** Create NFTs and certificates, transfer NFTs.
*   **Distributor/Retailer:** Receive and transfer NFTs (accepting transactions via wallet).
All these actions generate transactions on the Blockchain.

## Functional Description

Blockchain-based systems for anti-counterfeiting are implemented by developing a dedicated portal integrated with smart contracts for NFT management. The system is used by manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers, each equipped with a digital wallet.

The **Manufacturer**, authenticated with their digital identity, generates a detailed **digital certificate** for each product (production data, characteristics, warnings, warranty) and signs it digitally. This certificate is made **publicly viewable**. Subsequently, they calculate the unique cryptographic hash of this certificate and use a **smart contract** to create an **NFT token** uniquely associated with that product, embedding this immutable hash within it. The NFT token is initially held in the manufacturer's wallet.

The transfer of the physical product along the supply chain (Manufacturer -> Distributor -> Retailer -> Consumer) is accompanied by the **transfer of the NFT token** between the digital wallets of the involved parties. Each transfer is a transaction on the blockchain, recorded permanently and immutably. The NFT token thus evolves from a certificate of authenticity and traceability to a **digital title of ownership** of the physical asset once it reaches the consumer.

The **web portal / dApp verification** is a public interface accessible to all without the need for registration. Its sole purpose is to query the blockchain and the certificate repository on behalf of the user and display the results of the cryptographic verifications.

When a user scans the **QR code or RFID** on the product:
1.  The code contains an identifier (e.g., `0x123abc...` certificate hash or NFT ID).
2.  The device is redirected to the Public Verification Platform, passing this identifier.
3.  The Platform, **without requiring any login or personal data**, queries the blockchain to find the NFT token associated with that identifier and retrieves:
    *   The **certificate hash** stored in the token.
    *   The **public key** of the wallet that currently owns the token (the legal owner).
4.  The Platform then retrieves the **original digital certificate** from the public repository, using the received identifier.
5.  It **locally** calculates the SHA-256 hash of the retrieved certificate.
6.  **Trustless Comparison:** It compares the newly calculated hash with the one retrieved from the blockchain.
    *   **If they match:** The Platform displays a "**Product Authentic**" message. It also shows the **public key of the current owner**. In a store, the customer can compare this key with the one publicly displayed by the store (e.g., on a certificate of ownership on site) to verify the match before purchase.
    *   **If they do not match:** The Platform displays a "**Warning: Possible Counterfeit**" message. The hash on the public certificate does not match the one registered on the blockchain at the time of the product's creation, indicating that the certificate has been altered or the product is fake.
7.  **After purchase,** the transfer of the NFT token updates the ownership on the blockchain. A subsequent scan will show the public key of the new owner (the buyer), demonstrating the change of ownership in a transparent and trustless manner.

This process ensures that the verification of authenticity and legitimate ownership is completely decentralized, based on cryptographic proofs, and does not require trust in any of the involved parties or a central certification authority.

# MODULES

## Web Portal / Trustless Public Verification dApp
This module is fundamental to the trustless approach. It is a decentralized web application (dApp) or portal with the following characteristics:
*   **Public and Anonymous Access:** Does not require registration, login, or provision of personal data for basic verification.
*   **Simple Verification Interface:** A field to enter a code or a QR/RFID scanning feature.
*   **Blockchain Reader:** Connects to a blockchain node to query smart contracts and read NFT token data (certificate hash, current owner).
*   **Certificate Repository Client:** Retrieves digital certificates from the public repository based on the received identifier.
*   **Cryptographic Verification Engine:** Executes locally in the user's browser the calculation of the hash of the retrieved certificate and the comparison with the one on the blockchain.
*   **Clear Results Display:** Shows unequivocally the outcome of the verification (Authentic/Not Authentic) and the public key of the legitimate owner, without interpretations or the need to trust the portal itself.

## Blockchain and Smart Contract Integration
This module is fundamental and has several functions:
*   **Communication with the Blockchain:** Interacts with the blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum) using libraries like Web3.js or Web3.py to read data (hash, owners) and send transactions (transfers).
*   **Smart Contract Management:** Deploys and interacts with the smart contracts that govern the creation and transfer of NFT tokens.
*   **Node Type Selection:** Provides options for users to be a full node (which syncs the entire blockchain) or a light node (which relies on external providers to access data). For end users, light mode is preferable to reduce maintenance costs.

## Smart Contract
Similar to a value transfer on a blockchain, deploying a smart contract on a blockchain occurs by sending a transaction from a wallet for the blockchain. The transaction includes the compiled code for the smart contract as well as a special receiver address. That transaction must then be included in a block that is added to the blockchain, at which point the smart contract’s code will execute to establish the initial state of the smart contract. The smart contracts in this system manage:
*   The creation of NFT Tokens (with embedded certificate hash).
*   The rules for transferring tokens between wallets (ownership).
*   The maintenance of an immutable record of all transfers.

## End User Module

## Manufacturer
The manufacturer is the entity that brings the product to life in the digital system. In addition to purchasing raw materials and producing the good, it has the crucial task of:
*   Generating and digitally signing the **Digital Certificate** for each product or batch.
*   Publishing the certificate in a **Public Repository**.
*   Using a **smart contract** to mint the corresponding **NFT Token**, embedding the certificate hash.
*   Transferring the NFT token to the first subject in the supply chain (e.g., distributor).

## Distributors
As an intermediary in the supply chain, the distributor updates the digital ownership by receiving and transferring the NFT token, ensuring the digital chain of custody remains intact and verifiable.

## Retailers
The retailer is the final point of contact before the consumer. They purchase products (and NFT tokens) from the distributor and transfer them to final consumers at the time of sale. They have a direct interest in verifying the authenticity of the products they buy and correctly transferring ownership to ensure customer satisfaction and protect their own brand.

## Consumers
The consumer is the final owner. They can choose to participate in the network as a light node, verifying authenticity and ownership by querying the blockchain, or as a full node. They receive the NFT token at the time of purchase, becoming the registered owner of the asset.

# SECURITY ANALYSIS AND MODEL ROBUSTNESS

The proposed system introduces a radically new paradigm in authenticity verification and ownership management. To fully understand its value, it is necessary to analyze its robustness against potential attacks and clarify the practical philosophy behind the concept of digital ownership.

## Immunity to Cloning of the Physical Pointer

A common objection to QR code-based systems is the presumed ease with which a malicious actor can clone the code from an authentic product and apply it to a counterfeit one. However, this vulnerability is typical of centralized systems where the code *is* the credential. In our **decentralized and token ownership-based** system, the QR code is a **mere pointer** and its cloning does not confer any real advantage to the counterfeiter; on the contrary, it exposes them to immediate risks.

Consider two scenarios:

1.  **Cloning by the Legitimate Owner:**
    *   A dishonest retailer clones the QR code from an authentic item in their possession and applies it to a counterfeit item.
    *   When selling the fake, they would have to transfer the NFT token associated with the authentic item to the buyer to pass the verification.
    *   The result would be: the buyer of the fake receives an authentic token (and is satisfied), but the retailer loses the digital ownership of the original authentic item.
    *   The original authentic item, now devoid of its digital token (which has been transferred), would result as **unverifiable** and therefore unsellable, just like a counterfeit, destroying the value of the original asset.
    *   **Conclusion:** There is no economic incentive for a legitimate owner to perform this action, which equates to destroying the value of their own authentic asset to sell a fake. The only possible scenario is a fraud against themselves, with no gain.

2.  **Cloning by a Third-Party Malicious Actor:**
    *   A counterfeiter clones the QR code from an authentic product and applies it to fake products.
    *   However, they do not own the NFT token associated with that code, as it is held in the wallet of the legitimate owner.
    *   A buyer scanning the code on the fake will see that the token's ownership is attributed to a wallet that does not belong to the seller (the counterfeiter).
    *   The verification system will immediately show a **mismatch** between the registered owner (the public key exposed by the true owner) and the identity of the seller, generating an immediate **alarm** of possible fraud.
    *   **Conclusion:** Cloning only the QR code without possessing the corresponding token not only fails to deceive the system but immediately triggers it, protecting the consumer.

Therefore, the use of standard QR codes proves to be **sufficient and secure** in this architecture. The need for expensive anti-cloning tags (holograms, cryptographic NFC) becomes unnecessary, as security is not entrusted to the inviolability of the physical tag, but to the **impossibility of transferring digital ownership without the cryptographic consent of the token owner**.

## The Practical Model of Digital Ownership

The system operates on a **practical and consensual ownership model** that, while not formally replacing legal contracts, establishes an incontrovertible proof of ownership verifiable by all involved parties.

The manufacturer of the asset (typically for luxury goods, collectibles, or high-value items) provides its customers with a dedicated mobile application. This app fulfills three fundamental functions in a simple and intuitive way:
1.  **Simplified Wallet:** Securely stores the user's private keys and owned NFT tokens, completely abstracting the technological complexity (no seed phrase management for the end user, except through simplified and secure backups).
2.  **Instant Verification:** Allows verification of a product's authenticity and ownership simply by framing its QR code. The app automatically performs all cryptographic checks and shows a clear and immediate result (e.g., a green check mark and the manufacturer's name).
3.  **Guided Transfer:** Handles the transfer of ownership seamlessly during a sale.

**The Simplified Sales Flow:**

*   The **seller** (e.g., a store) has its POS system integrated with software that manages the corporate wallet.
*   The **buyer** has the manufacturer's app on their smartphone, with their own wallet already configured.
*   At the time of purchase, the cashier scans the product's QR code. The system automatically retrieves the token details.
*   Simultaneously, the buyer opens the app and perhaps generates a temporary QR code to receive the token.
*   The seller's POS system, with a click, initiates the transaction to transfer the NFT token from the store's wallet to the buyer's wallet.
*   The transaction is digitally signed by the store's wallet (transparently to the cashier) and broadcast to the blockchain.
*   Once confirmed, ownership is transferred. The buyer sees the new token magically appear in their app, confirming the completed transfer.

In this model, all parties know and accept the rules of the "game": possession of the token *equates* to ownership of the asset. The seller would have no interest in selling a fake product and transferring an authentic token, as it would destroy the value of the original asset. The customer, receiving the authentic token directly in their own app during the sale, has immediate and incontrovertible proof of having purchased a genuine product and being its new registered owner.

This system therefore rests not on a formal, imposing legal construct, but on an **ecosystem of shared value and a technologically enforced mechanism** that perfectly aligns the incentives of all parties, making fraud unprofitable and immediately detectable. Digital ownership becomes a practical convention, extremely robust and useful, that lives alongside the traditional legal system, providing an unprecedented tool for verification and transfer in terms of speed, security, and transparency.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The proposed system achieves a level of **decentralization and trustlessness** superior to existing solutions. The use of the NFT token as a representation of legal ownership, combined with the cryptographic verification mechanism that uses a simple QR/RFID code as a mere pointer, eliminates any centralized point of failure. Consumers can independently and without needing to trust the seller or a third-party entity verify both the product's authenticity and the legitimacy of its ownership before a purchase, simply by scanning a code and comparing public keys. This represents a significant advancement towards more transparent and secure commercial relationships.

# CONCLUSIONS

## Summary

In this project, an authentic product verification system based on blockchain technology and NFT tokens has been proposed, in which all histories of digital ownership transfer are perpetually recorded in an immutable ledger using smart contracts. The process of product registration, transfer, tracking, and verification is implemented through the collaboration of smart contracts and a trustless verification portal. Consumers can join the network as light nodes to verify authenticity and ownership. The system has evident **decentralized and trustless** characteristics, which eliminate the possibility of private data tampering and the need to trust a central verifier. The physical code on the product (QR/RFID) assumes the minimal and secure role of a simple link to the verification system, while the definitive proof of authenticity and ownership resides in the cryptographic mathematics and decentralized consensus of the blockchain. Through an in-depth analysis of the requirements, we designed a decentralized system based on blockchain and KYPC/NFT network. To alleviate the problem of data explosion, we use collaborative management of on-chain and off-chain data. To protect sensitive business information, we use enterprise-level smart contracts instead of traditional transactional records.
